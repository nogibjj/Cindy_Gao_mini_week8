# Mini Project 8: Rewrite a Python Script in Rust
## Requirements
* Take an existing Python script for data processing
* Rewrite it in Rust
* Highlight improvements in speed and resource usage <br><br>


## Raw Data
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/refs/heads/master/murder_2016/murder_2015_final.csv <br><br>
The dataset presents the numbers of murders in 2014 and 2015, grouped by different cities in the US. <br><br>

## Performance Report: Python VS. Rust
### Rust Performance
| Metric                  | Value               |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Execution Time          | 1.70 ms         |
| Memory Usage Before     | 17,029,037 KB       |
| Memory Usage After      | 17,029,037 KB       |
| Memory Consumed         | 0 KB                |

### Python Performance
| Metric                  | Value               |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Execution Time          | 0.30 ms             |
| Memory Usage Before     | 33,984 KB           |
| Memory Usage After      | 34,000 KB           |
| Memory Consumed         | 16 KB               |

### Comparison summary
| Language  | Execution Time | Memory Usage Before | Memory Usage After | Memory Consumed |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Rust**  | 1.70 ms    | 17,029,037 KB      | 17,029,037 KB      | 0 KB            |
| **Python**| 0.30 ms        | 33,984 KB          | 34,000 KB          | 16 KB           |

### Improvements in speed and resource usage
* __Speed:__ Python was faster for this simple task, with an execution time of 0.30 ms versus Rust's 1.70 ms. Python’s high-level optimizations can sometimes give it an edge in simpler operations.
* __Memory Efficiency:__ Rust showed zero memory growth, keeping memory usage constant, while Python consumed an additional 16 KB. Rust’s strict memory management makes it highly efficient, especially for larger applications.
* __Best Use Cases:__
Rust: Ideal for resource-intensive tasks where memory predictability and efficiency are crucial.
Python: Great for rapid prototyping and tasks where speed in development outweighs strict resource control.
* __Conclusion:__ Rust offers advantages in resource management and predictable memory usage, which can lead to better performance in high-demand applications. Python, however, remains a strong choice for rapid development and tasks where execution speed is prioritized over strict memory management.
